# SMART WHEELCHAIR

The wheelchair code consists of functions for servos. This helps to turn the servos as per the requirement. It consists of a local machine learning algorithm called qbehaves.This learns locally over time. The algorithm can be overriden by the means of a button. Patient monitoring is done by pushing data on to the cloud which can later be retrieved on to the android app. The android app can be used to control the wheelchair by direction or voice inputs.
Further Q-learning is used to predict the route.
